/**
 * which game a launch named, resolved once.
 *
 * **[MainActivity] used to carry this as three strings and re-derive the answer from them in five
 * places** -- `gameName`, `safGameName` and `safTreeUri`, with `startsWith("/")` deciding between a
 * staged directory and an absolute path wherever the question came up again. the app already had the
 * type that question has an answer in: [GameSource] is a staged directory or a document inside a
 * granted tree, and it is what the game list has always scanned into. so a launch resolves to one of
 * those, here, and everything downstream asks the source instead of reading the strings again.
 *
 * **the extras are the wire format and they stay exactly what they were.** what an `am start` sends
 * is unchanged, and so is what the game list sends -- see [GameLaunch]. this is the one place that
 * reads them.
 *
 * a launch that cannot name a game is a [Resolved.Refused] carrying the sentence a person is shown,
 * rather than a null each caller invents a message for. **that is the whole reason this returns a
 * type rather than a nullable source**: every way of failing here has something specific to say, and
 * the one thing none of them may do is fail quietly.
 *
 * ### the ways a game can be named
 *
 * | | |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `intent.data` | a tree uri naming the dump's directory or its `eboot.bin`. what an app outside this one sends |
 * | `--es game` | a directory under the app's own `games/`, or an absolute path to one anywhere |
 * | `--es safgame` with `--es saftree` | a directory inside a folder the user granted this app. what the game list sends for one |
 *
 * **the uri is tested first and the reason is not precedence but capability.** an emulation frontend
 * has the intent and nothing else: it cannot know what this app has staged, and it does not hold this
 * app's grants. the game list never sets `intent.data`, so nothing of ours is displaced by looking
 * there first.

     * PS5 dump is a directory -- an eboot beside `sce_sys/`, `sce_module/` and everything else the
     * guest opens -- and a uri from `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` is good for exactly one document, with no
     * way to reach its siblings. only a tree grant can be walked, so only a tree grant can boot a
     * game, and a single document is refused in words rather than half-working.
     *
     * **either end of the dump may be named**: the directory, or the `eboot.bin` inside it. a
     * frontend's database usually points at the file it scanned, and going up one level costs
     * nothing where guessing which was meant would.
     *
     * **who granted the uri is deliberately not asked.** it may be a transient grant the frontend
     * attached to the intent, or a folder the user gave this app long ago -- the question that
     * decides a launch is whether the dump can be read through it, and that is the question asked.
     *
     * **what the uri resolves to is a document only while the app has no better way to the file.**
     * with all-files access held it becomes an ordinary path, exactly as it does for a game tapped on
     * the list -- [AllFiles] decides, per launch, and both callers ask it the same question. that is
     * asked *before* the provider, because it is the answer that needs no grant: a folder nobody has
     * added to the library is unreachable through a provider and perfectly readable as a path.
     *
     * **and a grant attached to the intent does not reach inside the directory it names.** a uri
     * permission passed with an intent covers that one document; the eboot, `param.json` and the rest
     * are children of it, and a receiving app is refused when it asks for them. so the uri form
     * answers for a folder this app has been given -- which is what adding it under Game files does
     * -- or for any folder at all while all-files access is held, and the path form answers the rest.
