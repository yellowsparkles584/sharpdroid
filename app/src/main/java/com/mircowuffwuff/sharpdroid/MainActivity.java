/**
 * one activity, one SurfaceView, one guest -- <b>and one process, which ends with the run</b>.
 *
 * <p>the manifest puts this activity in {@code :guest}, and the reason is the guest's own exit: a
 * guest calling {@code exit_group} ends the process it is in, and the host layer answers with
 * {@code _exit} because the other guest threads are inside translated code and cannot be unwound.
 * sharing a process with the game list would make that the app dying with the game.
 *
 * <p><b>the other half is that this process is ended deliberately when a run finishes any other
 * way</b> -- see {@link #endRun}. a guest run leaves a loaded payload, a guest address space and a
 * JIT behind it, and none of that may reach the next run; a process that answered a second launch
 * would also be answering it from whatever it had cached of the settings store before the user
 * changed a row in the other process. so the invariant is one process per guest run, and it is what
 * makes two launches of one intent the same launch twice.
 *
 * <p>the payload lives in the app's own external files directory rather than in
 * {@code /data/local/tmp}, which is {@code shell_data_file} and which SELinux denies an app. that
 * costs nothing: the host layer maps guest images into anonymous memory and reads into them rather
 * than mapping them from a file, so a {@code noexec} volume is not a problem and never was.
