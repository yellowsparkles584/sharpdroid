# **it installs under its own application id.** the debug app is a different app to android -- its
# own internal storage, its own external files directory, its own save data -- so a deploy loop
# cannot disturb a personal install on the same phone.
#
# **omitting an argument is not "pick one for me".** it names nothing and lets the app answer:
#
#   no --game       the app opens its game list and no guest runs. this is the frontend run, and it
#                   is what running this with nothing else said gets you
#   no --sharpemu   no build is named, so the app runs what its build manager settled on -- which on
#                   an untouched install is the build it ships with. **that is a choice the app holds
#                   across runs**, so a run naming no build is not necessarily a run on the bundled
#                   one. name one when it has to be a particular build
#   no --driver     the app loads what its settings hold, which on an untouched install is the
#                   platform's own. `--driver none` pins that regardless of what is stored
#
# **this stages nothing the APK already carries.** the guest's x86-64 libraries ship inside it and
# the app unpacks them on the launch that needs them, so a deploy is the install and nothing else.
# staging them was once done here automatically, whenever fewer than twenty of the twenty-eight were
# on the device -- and that is precisely why nobody noticed for months that the APK carried none at
# all: the one machine able to see the gap re-created the missing set on every run, so the unpack
# path a user takes was never executed where a failure in it could be observed.
# `py scripts/stage.py --guest-libs` is still there, and is now only ever run deliberately.
#
# **the SharpEmu build is held constant unless you say otherwise**, and that is deliberate rather
# than lazy. rebuilding the emulator on every change to the host layer moves two variables per
# iteration and hands you a different payload from the one your last measurement used, which is the
# single mistake this project has recorded most often.
#
# **but a build that no longer matches the fork checkout is said out loud**, because the other half
# of that mistake is editing the fork and testing yesterday's payload with nothing erroring. a build
# records the commit it was cut from, marker and all, and the checkout is asked the same question, so
# an edit that has not been committed is a difference like any other -- which is the case this exists
# for -- and two trees that both have edits in them are a difference nothing can resolve rather than
# a match. naming a build prints the difference and carries on -- you chose it, it is yours to own --
# and a run that named none at all **stops**, because nobody chose and the two answers are not
# equivalent. it is never a question:
# stdin here is a pipe under anything driving this, and a prompt nobody can answer is a script
# nobody can automate.
